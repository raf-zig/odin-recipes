    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Russian salad recipe is what my mom and grandmother make every time there's a family gathering or a special occasion. Leave out the ham to make this a vegetarian dish. The potatoes, carrots, and eggs do not have to be completely chilled after boiling.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
    <ul>
        <li>6 potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 carrot, or more to taste</li>
        <li>4 whole eggs</li>
        <li>6 large pickles, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained</li>
        <li>½ cup cubed fully cooked ham, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

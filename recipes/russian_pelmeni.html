    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pelmeni are traditional Russian meat-filled dumplings. Making pelmeni is favorite family pastime in the long winter months. These dumplings are a common convenience food - big batches can be frozen and quickly boiled or fried on demand.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>   
    <h4>Dougt:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup warm water</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>18 ounces ground beef</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons ice-cold water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coarse salt</li>
        <li>freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine egg, vegetable oil, and salt in a measuring cup; add enough water to fill to 1 cup. Pour into a bowl, add 3 cups flour, and knead into a smooth, elastic dough. Cover with a kitchen towel and rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour.</li>
        <li>Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix filling thoroughly by hand or using a fork.</li>
        <li>Roll out a portion of the dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface and cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or a wine glass. Keep the rest of the dough covered with a towel to avoid drying out. Place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of filling on one side of the dough circle. Fold dough over and seal the edges using fingers, forming a crescent. Join the ends and pinch them together. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Freeze pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking together.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer and drop small batches of frozen pelmeni into simmering water. Cook and stir until the meat is cooked and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking for an additional 5 minutes. Transfer to serving plates using a slotted spoon.</li>
    </ol>
